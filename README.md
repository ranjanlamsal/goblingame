goblin and mario game
#This readme is for me and anyone helping me edit the code
game complete chhaina till date 10/02/2020.
main game theme:
- A game window with start game , help and setting opt(sound on / off) buttons (not designed)
-Start game button- game starts with a player and a goblin. (done)
-player hits goblin and if goblin life is finished the level will complete with score bar (done upto here ) and moves to next level (level sys not designed)
-if player touched the goblin it dies (designed but having trouble here)


Troubles:
whenever mario touches goblin, game didnt ended.
level completed with score 10 but after completion, whenever space button is hit the score increases ( the mario and goblin still on game behind the new screen)
